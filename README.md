## Build Requirements

In order to build the *maths* library, test code, examples, and documentation, a number of packages
are required.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake doxygen
```

Doxygen documentation is fine, but we can spruce up the styling using sphinx and breathe!

```
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
pip install breathe
```
